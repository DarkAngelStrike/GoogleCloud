  # disabled), so unconditionally using those commands has the opposite effect
  # on those two distributions.

  # distributions, so we use them as flags instead of commands.

    # /dev/sda1             10319160   1020760   8774216  11% /

    # After (on CentOS):
    # % df -B 1K /dev/sda1
    # Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
    # /dev/sda1            516060600   1041548 488811080   1% /
    #
    # On Debian, the device behind the root filesystem is not /dev/sda1 but a
    # disk with random UUID, e.g.,
    #
    # % df -B 1K /
    # Filesystem              1K-blocks   Used Available Use% Mounted on
    # /dev/disk/by-uuid/{...}  10320184 680336   9115612   7% /

    # % df -B 1K /dev/sda1
    # Filesystem     1K-blocks  Used Available Use% Mounted on
    # udev               10240     0     10240   0% /dev
